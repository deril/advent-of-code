#+title: This repository contains solutions for the [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]] event.

I created these solutions using Common Lisp, showcasing various programming techniques and problem-solving skills.

Each solution is organized by day and includes both the problem description and the corresponding code implementation. Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and use it as a reference for your own projects.
